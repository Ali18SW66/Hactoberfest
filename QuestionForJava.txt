Q8: Java doesn't support multiple inheritance right? Every class extends the Object class by default right?
    when we are extending a class then in reality a class is extending two classes i.e object and the one
    we mention after extends keyword so this is multiple inheritance explain?
	Example we have created class A which will extend Object since every user defined class does it.
	we created another class B which will for sure extend Object. so now if i write class B extends A
	it will extend two classes Object and A explain it

Class Test{
 public static void main(String[] args){
   int r = 3;
   System.out.print.ln("R= "+r);
 }
}
Class TestInner{
 public static void main(String[] args){
   String s = "      Hey.    ";
   System.out println(s.trim());
 }
}
